## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
curve(dt(x, 3), from=-4, to=4, lwd=2)
   curve(dnorm(x), add=TRUE, col="gray")
   abline(h=0, v=c(-1,1), col=c("gray","orange","orange"), lwd=c(1,2,2))
```

```{r}
cars.lm <- lm(dist ~ speed, data=cars)
    summary(cars.lm)
    confint(cars.lm)
    
    pt(-9.463990, 48)*2
  
    
    ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist))+
      geom_point()+
      geom_smooth()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
